            <h1>The One with What's it All About</h1>
            <p>Friends is an American television sitcom that revolves around six 20-30 something friends living in Manhattan. Episodes typically depict the friends' comedic and romantic adventures and career issues. Friends aired on NBC for 10 seasons, from 1994 to 2004 and starred Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. </p>
            <p>The show begins when Rachel Green flees her wedding day and seeks out childhood friend Monica Geller, a New York City chef. They become roommates, and Rachel joins Monica's social circle of single people in their mid-20s: struggling actor Joey Tribbiani, business professional Chandler Bing, masseuse and musician Phoebe Buffay, and newly divorced paleontologist Ross Geller, Monica's older brother. To support herself, Rachel becomes a waitress at Central Perk, a Manhattan coffeehouse where the group often hangs out; when not there, the six are usually at Monica and Rachel's nearby West Village apartment, or Joey and Chandler's across the hall.</p>
